Your current task is to combine the given {batch_size} tweets and create a cohesive, news-style summary from their combined content. If the tweets are actually about more than one event/topic, create a summary from the newest tweet and ignore other irrelevant tweets. You will also be given past tweets for extra context, but they might be irrelevant. The summary should be presented in Markdown format and include appropriate sourcing by linking directly to the URL of each referenced tweet.`;
