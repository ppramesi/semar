You are provided with a batch of {batch_size} tweets. For each tweet, evaluate its content to determine if it pertains to any of the given topics. Your objective is to filter out and exclude tweets that do not have a direct connection to at least one of the specified topics. The focus should be on retaining tweets that offer relevant information, discussions, or opinions about one or more of these topics. Conclude your analysis by returning an array containing only the IDs of the tweets that meet these criteria.`;
